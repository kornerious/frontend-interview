        "content": "## JavaScript Engine\nAt its core, a JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, or Chakra in Edge) is a program that executes JavaScript code. Its primary responsibilities include parsing the code, compiling it into machine code (often using Just-In-Time compilation), and then executing it. Despite modern optimizations like JIT compilation, JavaScript remains fundamentally single-threaded, meaning it processes one command at a time.\n\n### Key Components of the JavaScript Engine:\n\n*   **Memory Heap**: This is where memory allocation for objects and functions happens. It's an unstructured region of memory where reference type values (objects, arrays, functions) are stored.\n\n    ![JavaScript Memory Heap and Call Stack](images/js_engine_memory_heap.png)\n\n*   **Call Stack**: This is a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) stack that keeps track of the execution contexts of the program. When a function is called, its execution context is pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, its context is popped off the stack. Being single-threaded means there's only one call stack.\n\n    ![JavaScript Execution Context](images/js_engine_execution.png)\n\n## Execution Context\nAn Execution Context is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. Every time a JavaScript file loads, a function is called, or an `eval` statement is used, a new execution context is created. This context defines the environment where the current code is being run.\n\n### Components of an Execution Context:\n\n1.  **Variable Environment (Lexical Environment)**:\n    *   **Environment Record**: Stores all variable and function declarations within the current context. For function contexts, it also stores `arguments`. For global contexts, it stores global variables and functions.\n    *   **Outer Environment Reference**: A reference to the lexical environment of its outer (parent) context. This forms the 'scope chain' and allows the current context to access variables from its outer scopes.\n\n2.  **`this` Binding**: Determines the value of the `this` keyword for the current execution context. Its value depends on how the function was called.\n\n### Types of Execution Contexts:\n\n*   **Global Execution Context (GEC)**: The default or base execution context. It's created when the JavaScript file first loads. In a browser, the global object is `window`; in Node.js, it's `global`.\n*   **Function Execution Context (FEC)**: A new FEC is created whenever a function is called. Each function gets its own unique execution context.\n*   **Eval Execution Context**: Created when code is executed inside an `eval()` function. (Less common and generally discouraged due to security and performance implications).\n\n### Execution Context Life Cycle:\n\n1.  **Creation Phase**: Before the code is executed:\n    *   **Creation of Lexical Environment**: Memory is allocated for variables and functions. `var` declarations are initialized to `undefined`, `function` declarations are fully set up in memory. `let` and `const` are also initialized but placed in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until their actual declaration line is reached.\n    *   **`this` Binding**: The `this` value is determined and assigned.\n2.  **Execution Phase**: The code within the context is run line by line, assignments are made, and functions are called.\n\nWhen a function finishes execution, its execution context is popped off the Call Stack. If there's nothing else to execute, the global execution context is also popped off, and the program terminates.\n\n### Scope Chain\nThe scope chain is the mechanism by which JavaScript determines variable access. When a variable is accessed, the engine first looks in the current execution context's environment record. If not found, it looks in the outer environment's record, and so on, up the chain, until it reaches the global execution context. If the variable is still not found, a `ReferenceError` is thrown.",

        "content": "## Event Loop and Asynchronous JavaScript\nJavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it has only one call stack and can execute only one piece of code at a time. This would typically lead to a 'blocking' behavior for long-running operations (like network requests or heavy computations), where the browser would freeze until the operation completes. The Event Loop, along with Web APIs and the Task Queues, is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations, enabling asynchronous behavior without halting the main thread.\n\n### Components of the JavaScript Runtime Environment:\n\n1.  **Call Stack**: (As discussed in JavaScript Engine Theory) This is where your JavaScript code gets executed. Function calls are pushed onto the stack and popped off as they complete. If a function takes a long time, it blocks the stack.\n\n2.  **Web APIs (or Node.js C++ APIs)**: These are capabilities provided by the browser (or Node.js runtime) outside of the JavaScript engine itself. They include DOM APIs (`setTimeout`, `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `addEventListener`), and more. When an asynchronous operation is initiated in JavaScript, it's handed off to the appropriate Web API.\n\n    ![JavaScript Event Loop](images/js_event_loop.png)\n\n3.  **Callback Queue (Task Queue / MacroTask Queue)**: After a Web API finishes its work (e.g., `setTimeout` timer expires, `fetch` request completes, a DOM event occurs), the callback function associated with that operation is placed into the Callback Queue. This queue operates on a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) basis.\n\n    *   Examples of MacroTasks: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, I/O operations, UI rendering, `requestAnimationFrame` (though its priority is typically tied to browser rendering cycles).\n\n4.  **Microtask Queue (Job Queue)**: This queue holds 'microtasks', which have a higher priority than macrotasks. All microtasks in the microtask queue are executed before the next macrotask is taken from the callback queue.\n\n    *   Examples of Microtasks: Promise callbacks (`.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`), `async`/`await` functions (the `await` pauses execution and places the remainder of the function as a microtask), `MutationObserver`, `queueMicrotask`.\n\n5.  **Event Loop**: The Event Loop is the continuous process that orchestrates the execution of code. It constantly monitors two things:\n    *   **Call Stack Status**: Is the Call Stack empty?\n    *   **Queue Status**: Are there any pending tasks in the Microtask Queue or Callback Queue?\n\n    **Its fundamental rule**: The Event Loop will only push a task from a queue onto the Call Stack when the Call Stack is empty.\n\n### Event Loop Execution Order:\n\n1.  **Execute Script**: The JavaScript engine executes the current script (synchronous code) from top to bottom, pushing function calls onto the Call Stack.\n2.  **Process Microtasks**: Once the Call Stack becomes empty, the Event Loop checks the Microtask Queue. It dequeues and executes *all* microtasks one by one until the Microtask Queue is empty.\n3.  **Render (Browser only)**: After all microtasks are processed, the browser may perform a rendering update (re-render the UI).\n4.  **Process Macrotask**: The Event Loop then picks *one* task from the Callback Queue and pushes it onto the Call Stack for execution. (Note: Only *one* macrotask per loop iteration).\n5.  **Repeat**: Steps 2-4 repeat indefinitely as long as there are tasks in the queues, or the program is running.\n\nThis continuous process ensures that asynchronous operations don't block the main thread, allowing the UI to remain responsive while background tasks are being processed.",

Their role is to handle asynchronous operations that would otherwise block the single-threaded JavaScript engine. When JavaScript encounters an asynchronous operation (like a `setTimeout`, `fetch` request, or DOM event listener), it delegates this task to the relevant Web API.\n\n**Interaction Example (using `setTimeout`):**\n1.  When `setTimeout(callback, delay)` is called, JavaScript passes the `callback` function and `delay` to the Web API's timer functionality.\n2.  The `setTimeout` Web API starts a timer in the background, independent of the JavaScript Call Stack.\n3.  Immediately after delegating, the JavaScript engine continues executing the rest of the synchronous code on the Call Stack.\n4.  Once the specified `delay` expires, the Web API does *not* immediately execute the `callback`. Instead, it places the `callback` function into the **Callback Queue** (or Task Queue).\n5.  The Event Loop continuously monitors the Call Stack. When the Call Stack becomes empty, the Event Loop checks the Callback Queue (after checking the Microtask Queue).\n6.  If the Callback Queue contains the `setTimeout`'s callback, the Event Loop moves it from the queue to the Call Stack.\n7.  The `callback` function then executes on the Call Stack. \n\nThis mechanism ensures that long-running asynchronous operations don't freeze the user interface or block other synchronous code.",

The Event Loop processes only one task from the macrotask queue per loop iteration (after the Call Stack and Microtask Queue are empty, and potentially UI rendering).\n    *   **Usage:** Handles tasks like `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, `setImmediate()` (Node.js), I/O operations (e.g., `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest` completion), and UI rendering events (e.g., `click`, `resize`).\n    *   **Example Feature:** `setTimeout(() => console.log('Macrotask'), 0);` The callback `console.log('Macrotask')` enters the Macrotask Queue.\n\n2.  **Microtask Queue:**\n    *   **Priority:** Higher priority. The Event Loop processes *all* microtasks in the queue until it's empty, *before* moving on to the next macrotask or rendering UI.\n    *   **Usage:** Handles tasks like Promises (`.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`), `MutationObserver` callbacks, and `queueMicrotask()`.\n    *   **Example Feature:** `Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Microtask'));` The callback `console.log('Microtask')` enters the Microtask Queue.\n\n**In summary:** Microtasks are executed much sooner than macrotasks. If a microtask schedules another microtask, the newly scheduled microtask will also be executed within the *same* Event Loop iteration (before any macrotasks).

The simplified flow is:\n\n1.  **Execute Synchronous Code:** Runs until Call Stack is empty.\n2.  **Process Microtasks:** All microtasks from the Microtask Queue are executed.\n3.  **Render UI:** If there are pending visual changes (e.g., from DOM manipulations), the browser performs a repaint or reflow here. This is why a `setTimeout` with 0ms delay will still render before its callback, if rendering is due.\n4.  **Process One Macrotask:** One task from the Callback (Macrotask) Queue is picked and executed.\n5.  **Repeat.**\n\nThis means that for the UI to update, the Call Stack must become empty, and all microtasks must finish.

Even with a 0ms delay, `setTimeout` is an asynchronous Web API function. \n\n**Explanation using Event Loop:**\n1.  When `setTimeout(callback, 0)` is called, the `callback` function is registered with the browser's (or Node.js's) Web API for timers.\n2.  The browser's timer API then waits for 0 milliseconds. Once this 'delay' is over, the callback is *not* executed immediately. Instead, it's moved to the **Callback Queue** (or Macrotask Queue).\n3.  The JavaScript engine continues to execute any remaining synchronous code in the Call Stack.\n4.  Only when the Call Stack is completely empty, and *after* all tasks in the Microtask Queue have been processed, will the Event Loop pick up the `callback` from the Callback Queue and push it onto the Call Stack for execution.\n\nTherefore, `setTimeout(callback, 0)` means \"execute this callback as soon as possible, but only after all current synchronous code and all pending microtasks have finished and the Call Stack is clear.\"",

        "answer": "If a very long-running synchronous operation or an infinite loop occurs in JavaScript, it will block the Call Stack indefinitely or for a very long time. Because JavaScript is single-threaded, this has significant negative impacts:\n\n**Impact on Event Loop:**\n*   The Call Stack will never become empty (or will remain occupied for a long duration).\n*   As a result, the Event Loop cannot perform its duty of checking the Microtask Queue or the Callback Queue.\n*   No pending asynchronous callbacks (e.g., `setTimeout`, `Promise.then`, UI events, network responses) will be moved to the Call Stack for execution.\n\n**Impact on User Experience:**\n*   **Unresponsive UI:** The browser's main thread is completely blocked. This means the user cannot interact with the page (clicks, scrolls, keyboard inputs won't register), and the UI will freeze. Animations will stop, and rendering updates will not occur.\n*   **Perceived as a 'crash':** The application will appear unresponsive, leading to a poor user experience. Browsers often issue a 'page unresponsive' warning.\n*   **Network Requests:** Even if network requests complete, their callbacks will remain stuck in the queues and will not be processed until the blocking operation finishes.\n\n**Mitigation Patterns:**\n1.  **Break up heavy computations:** Divide the long-running task into smaller, manageable chunks. Use `setTimeout(..., 0)` or `requestAnimationFrame` (for animation-related work) to schedule these chunks across multiple Event Loop cycles. This allows the Event Loop to process other tasks (like UI rendering) in between.\n2.  **Web Workers:** For CPU-intensive computations that don't involve DOM manipulation, use Web Workers. Web Workers run in a separate thread, completely offloading the main thread and allowing the UI to remain responsive. Communication between the main thread and a Web Worker happens via message passing.\n3.  **Asynchronous APIs:** Always prefer asynchronous APIs (e.g., `fetch` instead of synchronous `XMLHttpRequest`) for I/O operations to avoid blocking.\n4.  **Debouncing/Throttling:** For frequently occurring events (like `mousemove`, `resize`, `scroll`), use debouncing or throttling to limit the rate at which event handlers are executed, reducing the synchronous workload.",

        "answer": "One potential disadvantage of the Constructor Pattern, especially when creating many instances, is the **inefficient creation of methods** if they are defined directly inside the constructor function using `this.method = function() { ... };`.\n\n**Explanation:** When methods are defined this way, a *new copy* of the method function is created and assigned to *each instance* every time a new object is created using the constructor. This leads to redundant function objects in memory for every instance, which can consume more memory and be less performant, especially if you have hundreds or thousands of objects with the same methods.\n\n**Mitigation:** The standard practice in JavaScript to avoid this is to define shared methods on the `constructor's prototype`. This way, methods are created only once and inherited by all instances, leading to better memory efficiency and performance.",

Each notification type might have different properties and methods (e.g., email needs a subject and recipient, SMS has a character limit, push notification has a device token). \n\nUsing a **Factory Pattern** (`createNotification(type, data)`): The client code would simply call `createNotification('email', { recipient: '...', subject: '...', body: '...' })` or `createNotification('sms', { phoneNumber: '...', message: '...' })`. The `createNotification` factory function would internally decide which concrete notification object (EmailNotification, SMSNotification, PushNotification) to instantiate and return. This decouples the client from knowing or importing `EmailNotification` or `SMSNotification` constructors/classes directly, making it easier to add new notification types later without modifying client code.\n\nUsing a **Constructor Pattern** directly would mean the client would have to know and explicitly call `new EmailNotification(...)` or `new SMSNotification(...)`, leading to more conditional logic in the client and tighter coupling.",

        "content": "The JavaScript runtime is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time. However, it's capable of handling asynchronous operations (like network requests, timers, or user interactions) without blocking the main thread. This is achieved through the Event Loop, a core concept in JavaScript's concurrency model.\n\n## Key Components:\n\n1.  **Call Stack (Execution Stack):** This is where synchronous code is executed. When a function is called, it's pushed onto the stack. When it returns, it's popped off. JavaScript executes code from top to bottom, one function at a time.\n    *   ![JavaScript Call Stack 1](images/event_loop_2.jpeg)\n    *   ![JavaScript Call Stack 2](images/event_loop_3.jpeg)\n    *   ![JavaScript Call Stack 3](images/event_loop_4.jpeg)\n    *   ![JavaScript Call Stack 4](images/event_loop_5.jpeg)\n    The sequence above shows how functions enter and exit the call stack, and how asynchronous callbacks are processed.\n\n2.  **Web APIs (Browser APIs / Node.js APIs):** These are capabilities provided by the runtime environment (browser or Node.js), not JavaScript itself. Examples include `setTimeout()`, `fetch()`, DOM events (e.g., `click`), and `XMLHttpRequest`. When an asynchronous operation is initiated, it's delegated to a Web API.\n\n3.  **Callback Queue (Task Queue / Macrotask Queue):** After a Web API completes its asynchronous operation (e.g., `setTimeout` delay expires, `fetch` response arrives, `click` event fires), the callback function associated with it is moved to the Callback Queue. This queue holds 'macrotasks' such as `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, I/O operations, and UI rendering.\n\n4.  **Microtask Queue:** This queue holds 'microtasks', which have a higher priority than macrotasks. Promises (`.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`) and `MutationObserver` callbacks are examples of microtasks. When the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop prioritizes processing all tasks in the Microtask Queue before moving to the Callback Queue or rendering.\n\n5.  **Event Loop:** The Event Loop is a continuously running process that orchestrates the execution flow. Its primary job is to constantly check if the Call Stack is empty. If the Call Stack is empty, it checks the Microtask Queue first and moves any pending microtasks to the Call Stack for execution. Once the Microtask Queue is empty, it then checks the Callback Queue and moves the oldest 'macrotask' (callback) to the Call Stack for execution.\n    *   ![JavaScript Event Loop 7](images/event_loop_6.jpeg)\n    The above diagram shows how the Event Loop connects the Call Stack, Web APIs, and Callback Queue.\n    *   ![JavaScript Event Loop Processing](images/event_loop_1.png)\n    This visualization demonstrates how asynchronous operations flow through the JavaScript runtime.\n    *   ![JavaScript Processing Model](images/event_loop_6.jpeg)\n\n## Event Loop Algorithm:\n\n1.  **Execute Synchronous Code:** All code in the Call Stack is executed until it's empty.\n2.  **Process Microtasks:** The Event Loop checks the Microtask Queue. If it's not empty, it takes all tasks from the Microtask Queue and pushes them one by one onto the Call Stack for execution until the Microtask Queue is empty.\n3.  **Render UI (if needed):** After microtasks are processed, the browser may render UI updates if there are any pending changes.\n4.  **Process Macrotasks:** The Event Loop checks the Callback Queue (macrotask queue). If it's not empty, it takes the oldest task and pushes it onto the Call Stack for execution. Only one macrotask is processed per loop iteration (unlike microtasks, where all are processed).\n5.  **Repeat:** The Event Loop continues this cycle indefinitely.",

            "explanation": "This example demonstrates the order of execution influenced by the Event Loop. \n1. `'Start'` is a synchronous call and executes immediately, pushed onto the Call Stack.\n2. `setTimeout` registers its callback with the Web API. Even with a 0ms delay, it's an asynchronous operation, and its callback `() => { console.log('Timeout callback'); }` is moved to the **Callback Queue** after the timer expires.\n3. `Promise.resolve().then()` immediately resolves, and its callback `() => { console.log('Promise callback'); }` is moved to the **Microtask Queue**.\n4. `'End'` is another synchronous call and executes immediately after `'Start'` because the Call Stack is not empty yet.\n5. At this point, the Call Stack becomes empty. The Event Loop kicks in. It first checks the **Microtask Queue** and finds the 'Promise callback'. This callback is moved to the Call Stack and executed, printing `'Promise callback'`.\n6. The Microtask Queue is now empty. The Event Loop then checks the **Callback Queue**. It finds the 'Timeout callback' and moves it to the Call Stack for execution, printing `'Timeout callback'`.\nThis illustrates the synchronous code's immediate execution, followed by higher-priority microtasks, and then lower-priority macrotasks.",

        "content": "Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Creational patterns, specifically, are concerned with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They provide flexibility and reusability for object creation.\n\n## Constructor Pattern\n\nThe Constructor Pattern is one of the most fundamental ways to create objects in JavaScript. It uses constructor functions (regular functions intended to be called with the `new` keyword) to create new objects. When `new` is used, a new object is created, `this` is bound to this new object, the constructor function is executed, and finally, the new object is returned.\n\n### Characteristics:\n\n*   **Definition:** A function designed to be used with the `new` operator.\n*   **Purpose:** To create instances of a particular type of object, initializing properties and methods.\n*   **Syntax:** Typically uses `this` inside the function to refer to the new instance.\n\n### Pros:\n\n*   Simple and straightforward for creating multiple instances of the same 'type'.\n*   Allows for inheritance using prototypes.\n\n### Cons:\n\n*   Methods defined directly on `this` inside the constructor are re-created for every instance, which can be inefficient for many objects (though modern JS engines optimize this). It's generally better to define methods on the prototype.\n*   Lacks true privacy without using closures (which adds complexity).\n*   Tight coupling between the client code and the constructor function (client must know `new Person()`).\n\n## Factory Pattern\n\nThe Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In JavaScript, this often translates to a function (the 'factory') that returns different types of objects based on some input parameters, without explicitly calling constructors (using `new`). It abstracts the object creation logic.\n\n### Characteristics:\n\n*   **Definition:** A function that returns an object, where the type of object returned can vary based on input.\n*   **Purpose:** To encapsulate and centralize the object creation logic, decoupling the client code from the concrete classes being instantiated.\n*   **Usage:** Useful when you need to create different types of objects that share a common interface or belong to a family of objects.\n\n### Pros:\n\n*   **Decoupling:** The client code doesn't need to know the specific constructors or classes; it only interacts with the factory function.\n*   **Flexibility:** Easily add new object types without modifying client code (Open/Closed Principle).\n*   **Centralized Creation:** All object creation logic is in one place, making it easier to manage and modify.\n*   Can hide complex initialization logic.\n\n### Cons:\n\n*   Adds an extra layer of abstraction, which can sometimes make the code harder to follow for simple cases.\n*   Can lead to a large factory function if many types of objects are handled.\n*   Can be overkill for very simple object creation needs.\n\nBoth patterns help manage complexity in different ways for object creation.",

This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as a logger, a configuration manager, or a database connection pool.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- **Single Instance:** Guarantees that only one object of a specific class can be instantiated.\n- **Global Access Point:** Provides a well-known global access point to that single instance.\n- **Lazy Initialization:** The instance is often created only when it's first requested, optimizing resource usage.\n- **Encapsulation:** The constructor is typically private or controlled to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class.\n\n## Use Cases\n- **Logger:** A single logging instance to write logs to a file or console.\n- **Configuration Manager:** A central place to manage application configurations.\n- **Database Connection Pool:** Ensures that only one pool of connections is managed.\n- **Caching:** A single cache instance for shared data.\n\n## Implementation Principles\nTo implement a Singleton, you typically:\n1.  Make the constructor private (or simulate it in JavaScript using closures or module patterns).\n2.  Create a static method or property that returns the single instance.\n3.  Inside this method, check if an instance already exists. If not, create it; otherwise, return the existing one.\n\n## Advantages\n- **Controlled Access:** Provides strict control over instance creation, preventing multiple instances where only one is desired.\n- **Resource Management:** Useful for managing shared resources (e.g., database connections, file handles).\n- **Namespace Management:** Avoids polluting the global namespace with multiple instances of a class.\n- **Lazy Loading:** The instance can be created only when it's first needed, saving resources.\n\n## Disadvantages\n- **Global State:** Can introduce global state into an application, making testing and debugging more difficult.\n- **Tight Coupling:** Can lead to tight coupling between the Singleton and its users.\n- **Testability Issues:** Can be challenging to unit test components that rely on Singletons, as mocking them can be tricky.\n- **Scalability:** In distributed systems, ensuring a truly unique instance across multiple processes can be complex.\n\nIn JavaScript, the Singleton pattern is often implemented using a Module Pattern (specifically an IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression) or using ES6 classes with static methods and private fields (though true private constructors aren't natively supported in the same way as in classical OOP languages).\n\n### IIFE-based Singleton\nThis is a common way to achieve Singleton behavior in JavaScript, leveraging closures to hide the instance and provide controlled access.",

It's often used to enable existing classes to work with others without modifying their source code.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- **Client:** The object that uses the adapter and expects a specific interface.\n- **Adaptee:** The existing object with an incompatible interface that needs to be adapted.\n- **Target Interface:** The interface that the client expects.\n- **Adapter:** The class that implements the target interface and wraps the adaptee, translating requests from the client to the adaptee.\n\n## Types of Adapters (Conceptual for JS)\n- **Object Adapter (Composition):** The adapter contains an instance of the adaptee class and calls its methods. This is the more common and flexible approach in JavaScript.\n- **Class Adapter (Inheritance):** The adapter inherits from the adaptee class. Less common/directly applicable in JavaScript's prototypal inheritance model, but conceptually possible if you consider extending an object's prototype chain.\n\n## Use Cases\n- **Integrating Legacy Systems:** When a new system needs to interact with an older component that cannot be modified.\n- **Third-Party Libraries:** Adapting a third-party library's API to fit an existing application's interface.\n- **Unifying Interfaces:** When multiple classes have similar functionality but different method signatures, an adapter can unify them under a common interface.\n- **Data Format Conversion:** Converting data from one format to another (e.g., XML to JSON for a UI component).\n\n## Implementation Principles\n1.  Identify the target interface (what the client expects).\n2.  Identify the adaptee (the class with the incompatible interface).\n3.  Create an Adapter class that implements the target interface.\n4.  Inside the Adapter, hold a reference to an instance of the adaptee.\n5.  Implement the target interface methods by translating the calls to the corresponding methods of the adaptee.\n\n## Advantages\n- **Interoperability:** Enables classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.\n- **Reusability:** Allows reusing existing code that wasn't designed to work with your current system.\n- **Decoupling:** Decouples the client from the specific implementation of the adaptee, promoting flexibility.\n- **Flexibility:** You can introduce new adaptees without changing the client code, simply by creating a new adapter.\n\n## Disadvantages\n- **Increased Complexity:** Introduces new classes and potentially more layers of abstraction.\n- **Performance Overhead:** A small overhead due to the extra layer of method calls.\n- **Debugging:** Can make debugging slightly more complex due to the additional layer.",

        "content": "The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. It's about 'wrapping' an object to add new responsibilities.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- **Component:** An interface (or abstract class) defining the operations that can be altered by decorators.\n- **Concrete Component:** An implementation of the component interface, representing the base object being decorated.\n- **Decorator:** An abstract class (or function/object) that mirrors the component interface and maintains a reference to a component object. It delegates requests to the wrapped component.\n- **Concrete Decorator:** Specific implementations of the Decorator that add new responsibilities to the component.\n\n## How it works\nThe Decorator pattern wraps the component object (either the concrete component or another decorator) with a decorator object. The decorator object then adds its own behavior and delegates the rest of the work to the wrapped component. This creates a chain of responsibility, where each decorator adds a layer of functionality.\n\n## Use Cases\n- **UI Widget Customization:** Adding borders, scrollbars, or other features to a window or text box without changing their core class.\n- **Stream Processing:** Adding compression, encryption, or buffering to a data stream.\n- **Logging/Monitoring:** Attaching logging or performance monitoring to existing functions or methods.\n- **Enhancing Objects Dynamically:** Adding features like authentication, caching, or validation to an object at runtime.\n\n## Implementation Principles\n1.  Define a common interface or set of methods for the base component and all decorators.\n2.  Create a concrete component that implements this interface.\n3.  Create a base Decorator that takes a component as an argument and also implements the common interface, delegating calls to the wrapped component.\n4.  Create concrete decorators that extend the base decorator and add specific new functionality before or after delegating to the wrapped component.\n\n## Advantages\n- **Flexibility:** Allows adding and removing responsibilities to objects at runtime.\n- **Avoids Subclassing Explosion:** Prevents a large number of subclasses that arise from combining multiple behaviors (e.g., `CoffeeWithMilk`, `CoffeeWithWhip`, `CoffeeWithMilkAndWhip`).\n- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each decorator can be responsible for a single added functionality.\n- **Transparent Wrapping:** The client can treat decorated objects and undecorated objects uniformly if they share the same interface.\n\n## Disadvantages\n- **Increased Complexity:** Can lead to a large number of small, similar objects.\n- **Difficulty in Removing Specific Wrappers:** Removing a wrapper from the middle of a stack of wrappers can be tricky.\n- **Identity Changes:** The identity of the object is changed by wrapping, which might be an issue if object identity is crucial.\n- **Over-decoration:** Too many layers of decorators can make the code harder to understand and debug.",

Changing the Singleton's implementation directly impacts all its consumers.\n3.  **Testability Issues:** Due to tight coupling and global state, Singletons are notoriously hard to unit test. It's difficult to isolate components that depend on Singletons because you can't easily mock or replace the single, globally accessible instance. This often requires complex setup/teardown in tests or reliance on dependency injection frameworks to mitigate.\n4.  **Scalability Concerns:** In distributed or serverless environments, ensuring a *truly* single instance across multiple processes or invocations can become a complex challenge, potentially requiring external coordination mechanisms.\n5.  **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle:** A Singleton often takes on two responsibilities: managing its own instance *and* providing its core functionality.",

        "answer": "Modern JavaScript development often prefers patterns that promote modularity and testability over strict Singletons:\n\n1.  **Module Pattern (ES Modules):** This is the most common and idiomatic way to achieve 'singleton-like' behavior in JavaScript. When you export an object or a function from an ES module, that object or function is instantiated and shared as a single instance *per module import*. Since modules are cached after their first import, any subsequent import of the same module will receive the exact same object. This offers similar benefits to Singleton (single instance, global access within the module system) but avoids global state pollution and is inherently more testable as you can often mock module imports in testing frameworks.\n    ```javascript\n    // config.js\n    const config = {\n      apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',\n      timeout: 5000\n    };\n    export default config; // Single instance exported\n\n    // app.js\n    import config from './config.js';\n    console.log(config.apiUrl);\n    ```\n2.  **Dependency Injection (DI):** Instead of having components directly call a static `getInstance()` method on a Singleton, components declare their dependencies, and these dependencies are 'injected' (provided) at runtime. A DI container or a simple factory can be responsible for ensuring that a specific dependency (e.g., a logging service) is only instantiated once and then consistently provided to all components that need it. This makes components much more testable because you can inject mock dependencies during tests.\n    ```javascript\n    class Logger {\n      log(message) { console.log(`LOG: ${message}`); }\n    }\n\n    // Factory/Container ensures single instance\n    const loggerInstance = new Logger(); \n\n    class MyService {\n      constructor(logger) { // Logger is injected\n        this.logger = logger;\n      }\n      doSomething() {\n        this.logger.log('Doing something...');\n      }\n    }\n\n    const myService = new MyService(loggerInstance);\n    ```",

        "answer": "While both a Singleton and a global variable provide a single point of access to an object, the Singleton pattern offers more control and benefits:\n\n1.  **Controlled Instantiation:** A Singleton explicitly controls when and how the single instance is created (often lazily initialized on first access). A global variable can be initialized immediately at script load, or worse, can be accidentally or maliciously overwritten by other parts of the code.\n2.  **Encapsulation:** The Singleton pattern typically encapsulates the instance creation logic, hiding the details of how the instance is created or retrieved. In JavaScript IIFE-based Singletons, the `instance` variable is kept private within the closure. A global variable exposes the instance directly, allowing direct manipulation or re-assignment.\n3.  **Lazy Loading:** Singletons can implement lazy loading, meaning the instance is only created when it's actually requested via `getInstance()`. A global variable might be initialized immediately, consuming resources even if the object is never used.\n4.  **Namespace Pollution:** A global variable directly pollutes the global namespace. While a Singleton provides a global *access point*, it typically encapsulates its internal state, often exposing only a single global object (e.g., `Singleton.getInstance()`) rather than multiple variables.",

        "answer": "Even though JavaScript's main thread is single-threaded, concurrency can be introduced via Web Workers or asynchronous operations. When implementing a Singleton, particularly one that manages shared resources or state that workers might access, these considerations arise:\n\n1.  **Web Workers:** Each Web Worker runs in its own isolated thread with its own global scope. A Singleton implemented in the main thread is *not* automatically a Singleton across Web Workers. Each worker would typically create its own instance if it imported and used the Singleton module. To have a *single instance across workers*, you would need a shared mechanism, like `SharedWorker` or a central server if dealing with backend-managed state.\n2.  **Asynchronous Initialization:** If a Singleton's `createInstance` method involves asynchronous operations (e.g., fetching initial configuration from an API), race conditions can occur. Multiple calls to `getInstance()` might happen concurrently before the first asynchronous initialization completes. This could lead to multiple instances being created. To prevent this, a mechanism like a Promise-based initialization or a lock (simulated using a flag and a queue) is needed:\n    ```javascript\n    const AsyncSingleton = (function() {\n      let instancePromise = null;\n      async function createInstance() {\n        // Simulate async operation\n        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));\n        return { data: 'loaded config' };\n      }\n      return {\n        getInstance: function() {\n          if (!instancePromise) {\n            instancePromise = createInstance(); // Start creation\n          }\n          return instancePromise;\n        }\n      };\n    })();\n\n    // Usage:\n    AsyncSingleton.getInstance().then(inst => console.log(inst.data));\n    AsyncSingleton.getInstance().then(inst => console.log(inst.data)); // Will resolve with the same instance\n    ```\n\nIn summary, while the core `if (!instance)` check works for synchronous creation, asynchronous initialization or cross-worker sharing requires additional synchronization or communication patterns.",

You might write a utility function or a class (an explicit adapter) to transform the raw API response into a format suitable for your UI.\n    *   *Scenario:* A component expects `camelCase` keys (`firstName`, `email`), but the API returns `snake_case` (`first_name`, `email_address`). An adapter function like `formatUserData(apiData)` would convert `apiData.first_name` to `data.firstName` before passing it to the component.\n\n2.  **Event Normalization (Implicit Adapter):** Browser DOM events can be inconsistent across different browsers or have verbose interfaces. Libraries like jQuery historically, and modern frameworks often internally, normalize these events to provide a consistent `SyntheticEvent` (React) or `Event` object (`Vue`/`Angular`) that abstracts away browser differences. This 'normalization' layer acts as an adapter, translating various native browser events into a single, consistent interface for your application code.\n    *   *Example:* React's `SyntheticEvent` wraps native browser events (`MouseEvent`, `KeyboardEvent`, etc.) and provides a consistent interface (e.g., `e.preventDefault()`, `e.stopPropagation()`) regardless of the underlying browser implementation. You interact with `SyntheticEvent`, not directly with the varying native DOM events.",

It uses its inherited methods to satisfy the Target interface.\n*   **Limitations:** Requires multiple inheritance in languages that support it (which JavaScript does not in the classical sense). Less flexible as it's tied to a specific Adaptee class through inheritance.\n*   **Less Common in JavaScript:** Not a direct fit due to JavaScript's single-prototype inheritance.

This leads to a combinatorial explosion of classes.\n2.  **Dynamic Behavior:** Decorators allow adding responsibilities to objects at runtime, dynamically. With inheritance, the functionality is fixed at compile time (when the class is defined).\n3.  **Flexibility:** Decorators allow you to combine features in arbitrary ways. You can wrap an object with any decorator at any time, in any order. With inheritance, the hierarchy is fixed.\n4.  **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each decorator can be responsible for adding just one specific behavior, promoting cleaner, more modular code, whereas a subclass might become bloated trying to incorporate multiple inherited behaviors and new ones.",

        "answer": "React Hooks, especially custom hooks, share a conceptual similarity with the Decorator pattern in their ability to add reusable behavior to components (objects) without modifying their original structure. However, they achieve this through composition rather than object wrapping.\n\n*   **Decorator Analogy:** A decorator 'wraps' an object to add new responsibilities. Similarly, a custom hook 'wraps' (or more accurately, is `used by`) a functional component to provide it with reusable stateful logic or side effects.\n\n*   **How Hooks achieve 'Decoration':**\n    *   **Composition over Inheritance:** Instead of extending a component class (which is how `HOCs` often tried to 'decorate'), custom hooks use function composition. A component 'uses' a hook, integrating its logic directly.\n    *   **Dynamic Addition:** You can add or remove custom hooks from a component dynamically (at render time based on conditions, though usually statically declared), just as you can add or remove decorators from an object.\n    *   **Transparency (mostly):** The component receives the enhanced state/behavior from the hook without necessarily knowing the hook's internal implementation details. The component itself isn't structurally altered.\n\n*   **Example:**\n    ```javascript\n    // 'Component' (the base object)\n    function MyComponent() {\n      // 'Decorating' with reusable logic\n      const { data, loading, error } = useDataFetching('/api/items');\n\n      if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;\n      if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;\n      return <div>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;\n    }\n\n    // 'Decorator' (the custom hook)\n    function useDataFetching(url) {\n      const [data, setData] = React.useState(null);\n      const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(true);\n      const [error, setError] = React.useState(null);\n\n      React.useEffect(() => {\n        async function fetchData() {\n          try {\n            const response = await fetch(url);\n            const json = await response.json();\n            setData(json);\n          } catch (err) {\n            setError(err);\n          } finally {\n            setLoading(false);\n          }\n        }\n        fetchData();\n      }, [url]);\n\n      return { data, loading, error };\n    }\n    ```\n    Here, `useDataFetching` 'decorates' `MyComponent` with data fetching capabilities, much like a decorator adds new behavior. The component itself doesn't need to implement the data fetching logic directly.",

Implement a `GiftWrapDecorator` that takes a `product` as input. It should add $5 to the cost and append ', Gift-wrapped' to the description.\n2.  Implement an `ExpressShippingDecorator` that takes a `product` as input. It should add $10 to the cost and append ', Express Shipping' to the description.\n3.
