  const prompt = `You are an expert content analyzer for frontend interview preparation. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the provided markdown content and transforming it into a comprehensive theory, questions, and tasks.
! CRITICAL: YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE RAW JSON ONLY. Return your response as plain JSON without wrapping it in markdown code blocks (do NOT use \`\`\`json ... \`\`\`). 
! Make sure that your response should not be more than 60000 tokens.

! Stage 1: Extract theory blocks from provided markdown content. 
- Important! Translate non-English content to English and normalize code style.
- Create multiple theory blocks for distinct topics or concepts Include ALL subtopics and ensure theory blocks contain proper explanations.
- Add few practical code examples that demonstrate the concepts in the theory block, they should be short.
- When a concept is under-explained or ambiguous or missing, you may use your expertise to fill in missing details or clarify â€” just keep it concise, stay faithful to the original intent.
- Text, code blocks, examples should be a related content.
- Preserve all image references from the markdown. DO NOT modify image paths - keep them exactly as they appear in the original markdown.
- If there is generally the same information in markdown content, it should be in one theory block, and you should make it compact.

! Stage 2: EXTRACT QUESTIONS from provided markdown content (MAXIMUM QUANTITY and COMPLEXITY).
- Generate as many questions, coding tasks, theory blocks, flashcards as possible. 
- Each question should be directly related to concepts in the provided markdown content.
- If you see existing questions in the content (like "?"), extract them AND create variations.
- Break down some complex concepts into simple questions.
- Include a mix of different types - mcq, code, open, flashcard.
- For MCQs: create plausible but clearly incorrect distractors, focus on conceptual and practical scenarios.
- For Coding Challenges: can include edge cases and performance optimizations etc...
- For Open-Ended Questions: can encourage critical thinking and detailed explanations etc...
- Create questions at different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- Ensure questions test both basic understanding and advanced application.
- Include explanations and analysis points for each answer.
- Can be a question: Features mentioned briefly without examples, Content phrased as questions with answers, Small code snippets demonstrating a feature.

! Stage 3: Generate practical coding tasks for EACH theory block.
- Tasks should be realistic and relevant to frontend interviews.
- Include clear requirements, starting code templates, and solution code.
- Provide multiple test cases that cover edge cases.
- Include helpful hints that guide without giving away solutions.
- Tasks should range from simple implementation to complex problem-solving - Comprehensive implementation scenarios, Content asking to implement or create something, Practical coding exercises, implementation challenges, Multi-feature integration exercises, Best practice demonstrations etc...

! GUIDELINES:
- learningPath can be: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced" | "expert".
- COMPLETE ALL FIELDS: Every single field in the JSON structure must be filled with high-quality content:
- No empty arrays or placeholder text.
- Include metadata (tags, complexity ratings, etc.).
- Create proper relationships between theory, questions, and tasks.
- Use descriptive IDs that reflect content (e.g., "theory_event_loop", "question_event_loop_1").
